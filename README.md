Second Project - Non-Linear Classifier for Digit Analysis

The second project for the MIT MicroMasters Program course on Machine Learning with Python was aimed in discovering
non-linear ways to classify digits using the famous MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database.

The MNIST database contains binary images of handwritten digits collected from among Census Bureau employees and high school
students, and it is commonly used to train image processing systems. The database contains 60,000 training images and
10,000 testing images; All of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed size of 28 x 28 pixels.

Additional helper functions were given to complete the project in two weeks of time.
